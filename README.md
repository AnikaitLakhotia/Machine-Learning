<h1>Machine-Learning README</h1>

This repository contains a collection of projects in computer vision, natural language processing, time series forecasting and structured data. 
Each project showcases the application of machine learning algorithms to solve specific problems in these domains. 

<h3> Computer Vision: </h3>

 **1. CIFAR_10_with_Conv_Net:**
In this project, an image-classification model was built on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 90% and a validation loss of less than 0.63.

**2. CIFAR_10_with_ResNet_56:**
This project employs a pretrained ResNet-56 model instead of the custom-built CNN used inCIFAR_10_with_Conv_Net.

**3. Fashion_MNIST:**
This project focuses on building an image-classification model on the Fashion MNIST dataset. The model achieved a validation accuracy of 94% and a validation loss of less than 0.38. 

<h3>Natural Language Processing:</h3>

**4. IMDB:**
This project addresses the IMDB movie-review-classification problem. The model achieved an 87% validation accuracy and a validation loss of 0.34. 

<h3>Time Series:</h3>

**5. Weather_Forecasting:**
This project involves the creation of a weather-forecasting tool with a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss of less than 0.48. 

<h3>Structured Data:</h3>

**6. Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection:**
In this project, a credit card fraud detection model was built using imbalanced credit card data. The model achieved a validation loss of 0.00015, a precision of 0.13, and a validation recall of 86% or higher. 

Feel free to explore each project for more detail.
